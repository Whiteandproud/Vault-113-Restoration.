<h1>Welcome to Fallout 13</h1>

<i><b>The development is on early Alpha stage, so don't expect the full size wasteland or lots of other post-nuclear miracles you dream of.</a></b></i>

<i>The server is running a <a href="https://github.com/Whiteandproud/Vault-113-Restoration.">Modified Fallout 13 Git build</a>, based off /tg/ Station 13.</i>
<i>Enjoy the results of our work, and be sure to support us.</i>
